		subtypeChoices:
		
		membrane: potential is 0 on the volume surface, >0 everywhere else.
		(e.g. particles on a sphere that is defined as membrane stay on the surface of the sphere)
	
		attractive: potential is 0 in the inside of the volume >0 everywhere else
		(e.g. particles on a sphere that is defined as attractive are attracted to the inside of it and stay there)
		
		repulsive: potential is 0 on the outside of the volume >0 on the inside.
		(e.g. particles on a sphere that is defined as repulsive are pushed out from the inside and stay on the outside)
		
		consider particleRadius:
		if false, only the center of the particle matters for particle-geometry distance computation for potentials and the radius is ignored.
		(e.g. attractive sphere: particles start to feel the potential when their center gets outside the sphere.)
	
		if false, the center+radius of the particle matters for particle-geometry distance computation for potentials.
		(e.g. attractive sphere: particles start to feel the potential when center+radius gets outside the sphere)
